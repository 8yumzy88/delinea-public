Revvity Privileged Access Management (PAM) System: Terms of Use
1. Introduction
This document outlines the terms and conditions for accessing and using the Revvity Delinea Privileged Access Management (PAM) system (hereafter "the System"). This System is the property of Revvity and is intended for a limited and specific set of business purposes.

2. Scope and Authorization
Access to this System is a privilege, not a right. It is strictly restricted to authorized Revvity employees, contractors, and designated third-party vendors ("Authorized Users") who require privileged access to perform their specific, assigned job duties. All access is granted on the principle of least privilege.

3. System Definition and Purpose
The Delinea PAM system is a critical security control that manages, monitors, and audits all privileged accounts and access within the Revvity environment. Its purpose is to protect Revvity's most sensitive data and critical infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, and theft.

4. Monitoring and No Expectation of Privacy
You have NO expectation of privacy while using this System.

All activities, connections, and sessions initiated through or on this System are subject to monitoring, recording, logging, and auditing without further notice. This includes, but is not limited to, keystrokes, commands entered, and full session video recording.

This information may be intercepted, inspected, and disclosed to authorized Revvity personnel (such as Cybersecurity, HR, and Legal) and to law enforcement agencies for any purpose, including investigating potential misuse or criminal activity.

5. Authorized User Responsibilities
As an Authorized User, you are personally accountable for all actions taken with your credentials. You MUST:

Protect Your Credentials: Never share your password, MFA token, or other access credentials with anyone, including managers or IT staff.

Prevent Unauthorized Access: Secure your workstation when unattended and log off from the PAM system when your session is complete.

Adhere to "Least Privilege": Only access the systems, secrets, and data for which you have explicit authorization and a legitimate business need. Do not attempt to access any resource beyond your approved scope.

Prohibit Bypassing Controls: Do not attempt to circumvent, disable, or bypass any security or monitoring controls within the System.

Report Incidents: Immediately report any suspected or actual security incidents, policy violations, or suspicious activity to the Revvity Cybersecurity Operations Center (CSOC) at [Insert Revvity Security Contact Email/Portal].

6. Consequences of Violation
Failure to comply with these terms is a serious offense. Any unauthorized access, misuse, or violation of this policy will result in immediate revocation of access and may lead to one or more of the following:

Employment Implications: For Revvity employees, violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment.

Contractual Implications: For contractors or vendors, violations may lead to the immediate termination of contractual agreements and potential financial penalties.

Legal Implications: Unauthorized or malicious use of this System may constitute a criminal offense. Revvity reserves the right to report any such activity to law enforcement and to pursue all available civil or criminal legal actions to the fullest extent of the law.

7. Acceptance of Terms
By clicking "Accept" or by logging into and using the Revvity Delinea PAM system, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and explicitly consent to be bound by all terms and conditions set forth in this document.

If you do not agree to these terms, disconnect immediately.
